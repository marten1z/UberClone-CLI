# UberClone-CLI
Hello there!

The main program to compile and run is 'TMUberUI'.

NOTE the following: ONLY IF RUNNING IN IDE, COMMAND PROMPT SHOULD BE GOOD.
If it does not compile straight away, then instead of typing "javac TMUberUI", type "javac TMUberUI -Xlint",
this is due to the serviceRequests array of queues having an unchecked data type, so as the compiler chooses
the 'Safe' route it does not compile with "javac TMUberUI" sometimes.

Thank you!
